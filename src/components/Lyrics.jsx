Always saw my glass as<br/>
Half empty, it was never full<br/>
You were always passive<br/>
And I was irresponsible<br/>
Didn't have a chance but<br/>
We were scared to let things go<br/>
Young, in love, broken hearts<br/>
Holdin' on to our false hope<br/>
Had your whole life planned out<br/>
I had no clue who I was<br/>
Gave it all we had, but<br/>
Guess our all wasn't enough<br/>
Wonder where you're at now<br/>
Did you ever find the one?<br/>
Hope you're out there somewherе happy<br/>
Sometimes, I think of ya<br/>
[Pre-Chorus: NF]<br/>
(Ooh-ooh, ooh) Yeah, yеah<br/>
And it makes me sad<br/>
(Ooh-ooh, ooh) Mm-mm, yeah<br/>
The way you left<br/>
(Ooh-ooh, ooh)<br/>
But I'm glad you did<br/>
It was for the best<br/>

[Chorus: NF]<br/>
I pray, someday<br/>
You find yourself<br/>
Somehow, someway<br/>
With someone else<br/>
Don't wait, it's too latev
To keep holding on<br/>
Yeah, I'm already gone<br/>

[Verse 2: Julia Michaels]<br/>
Yeah, I could blame us breakin'<br/>up on bein' too young and bein' too dumb<br/>
And bein' too caught up on past traumas<br/>
But the truth is, we just weren't right,<br/> we planned our whole life<br/>
And we both knew we should've<br/>just ended on the first night<br/>
And I know if I would have stayed with you<br/>
I would've been down on luck and done with love<br/>
And done too much to make you stay<br/>
Second-guessin' and resentin' all the love<br/>
I could've gave to someone else<br/>
Got carpal tunnel from holdin'<br/> on to what we once felt<br/>
I'm happy for you, I am<br/>
Yeah, don't get me wrong, I am<br/>
And once in a while, it's true<br/>
I think about you too<br/>
Yeah, I do<br/>
I think about you too<br/>
(Ooh-ooh, ooh) Mm, yeah<br/>
And it makes me sad<br/>
(Ooh-ooh, ooh) Oh-oh, yeah<br/>
The way you left<br/>
(Ooh-ooh, ooh) Oh-oh-oh<br/>
But I'm glad you did<br/>
It was for the best (Yeah, yeah, oh-oh-oh)<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus: NF & Julia Michaels, Julia Michaels, NF]<br/>
I pray that someday<br/>
You find yourself<br/>
Somehow, someway (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br/>
With someone else<br/>
Don't wait (Don't wait), <br/>it's too late (It's too late)<br/>
To keep holding on<br/>
Yeah, yeah, I'm already gone<br/>
<br/>
[Outro: NF, Julia Michaels, NF & Julia Michaels]<br/>
Mm, yeah<br/>
I'm already gone<br/>
I'm already gone<br/>
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah<br/>
Yeah, yeah-yeah<br/>
I'm already gone<br/>
Oh<br/>
